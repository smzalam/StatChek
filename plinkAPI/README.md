<!-- ## Motivation
Usually in hockey, the best offensive players are spread out on the first and second lines. The third and fourth lines then comprise of players that are decent at what they do and do the small things well. 

Same goes for defensive hockey lines, although it is more spread out with the first and second pairing often being split up in terms of best defensive players.

The point of this analysis is to figure out which players in the vast talent pool the Maple Leafs have performed the best together, possibily giving an idea of how to group players together on these line combinations.

## Important Considerations

There are a few imporant things to note about this analysis.

    - Only players who have been with the Maple Leafs for 2 or more years will be considered in this study. 
      The motivation for this is to study lines combinations that have been together for a considerable amount of time rather than combinations that were made up on the fly for the purpose of innovation, game situations, or injuries.

    - There are a plethora of questions to address in this analysis such as, but not limited to, the following:
        * Which players have been with the Maple Leafs for a considerable amount of time (> 1.5 seasons)?
        * On all the different lines they were on, which line did they perform the best on? 
        * Which line did they perform the worst on? 
        * How did the slumps and hot streaks of the player affect the line performances?
        * Despite their performances, how do those lines compare against other lines? 
        * Did their performance bog the line and, subsequently, the team down?
        * How did the line perform in different game situations:
            - From behind?
            - From ahead?
            - In the Playoffs?
            - In the regular season?
            - During comeback situations?
    During this analysis, it will be impossible to answer all these questions due to insufficient data sets access, organization and structuring of data issues, etc. 
    However, once the initial analysis is done, a slow, thorough dive will be taken into exploring this analysis further once the required data sets and skills to perform those analysis are acquired. -->
